Task Manager for RTOS, OS.
This code is an easy task manager that can be used in microprocessors. I have only the processors at AVR, so I tried to write the code for them, but also the files in the kernel I write cross-platform, so that the code is very suitable for x86, ARM, PIC, MSP430 and other architecture.

Code contains some errors, I try to fix them. If you find errors in your code you ask me to write about them. Thank you.
